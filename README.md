## Motivation

Often times it will be difficult to pull out any biological understanding from a small list of differentially expressed transcripts/proteins/metabolites/etc. 

This repo covers techniques for the analysis of gene set enrichments, pathway analysis, gene ontologies, functional analysis of metabolomic profiling and coexpression networks.

These scripts cover statistical problems and solutions in functional analysis of high-throughput data and gives an overview of commonly used functional analysis techniques (GSEA, gene ontologies, MSigDB, tmod, metabolic profiling) as well as multivariate techniques and machine learning.

This repo has several sections
